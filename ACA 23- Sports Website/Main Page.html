			<h1>HISTORY OF IPL?</h1>
			<p>The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league, contested by eight teams 
				based out of eight different Indian cities.
				<br><br>
				The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007, with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises.
				The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket 
				Council (ICC) and the BCCI were not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board
				<br><br>
				To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in their own domestic tournaments
				 and also imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which was considered a rebel league by the board.
				<br><br>
				On 13 September 2007, on the back of India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup, BCCI announced a franchise
				-based Twenty20 cricket competition called Indian Premier League. The first season was slated to start in
				April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi.

				average attendance among all sports leagues. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting
				event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 
				2019 was ₹47,500 crore (US$6.7 billion), according to Duff & Phelps. According to BCCI, 
			    the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$160 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.

				<h1>Social distancing</h1>
				<p>Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control actions intended to
					slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals. Methods include
					quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or
					shopping centres. Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting
					travel, avoiding crowded areas, using no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves
					from others. Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions
					affected by the outbreak. Non-cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to
					the further spread of the pandemic.

					<br>
					The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government bodies and health organisations was
					swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there were no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people,
					and later to 10. On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. A
					Cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in
					limiting the pandemic, but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain, as local
					conditions vary.
					<br>

			<div>
				<h1>Face masks and respiratory hygiene</h1>
				<p>The CDC and WHO recommend individuals wear non-medical face coverings in public settings where there
					is an increased risk of transmission and where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.
					This recommendation is meant to reduce the spread of the disease by asymptomatic and pre-symtomatic
					individuals and is complementary to established preventive measures such as social distancing. Face
					coverings limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking,
					breathing, and coughing. Many countries and local jurisdictions encourage or mandate the use of face
					masks or cloth face coverings by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus.
